# Java Swing MVC Template

## Overview
This project provides a template for building Java Swing applications following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It aims to offer a structured approach for developing GUI applications in Java with separation of concerns and maintainability.

## Features
- **Model**: Represents the application's data and business logic.
- **View**: Presents the graphical user interface (GUI) to the user.
- **Controller**: Handles user input and updates the model and view accordingly.

## Components
1. **Model**: Contains classes representing application data and logic.
2. **View**: Includes Swing components for the graphical interface.
3. **Controller**: Coordinates interactions between the model and view.

## How to Use
1. **Model**: Implement classes representing your application's data and business logic.
2. **View**: Design GUI components using Swing classes (e.g., `JFrame`, `JPanel`, `JButton`).
3. **Controller**: Implement controller classes to handle user input and update the model and view accordingly.
4. **Integration**: Connect the model, view, and controller components following the MVC pattern.
